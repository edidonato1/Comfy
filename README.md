### Technical challenge for Comfy App
_The Challenge:_

Your challenge is to print a list of all the words used in a sample of text. For each word you must also provide the number of times that word appears. Consider the following text from J.D. Salingerâ€™s The Catcher in the Rye:

"Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be. "

The output of your code should resemble the following:

anyway=1

i=8

keep=1

picturing=1

all=5

these=1

little=2

   kids=2

   playing=1

   some=1

   game=1

   in=2

   this=1

   big=2

   field=1

   of=3

   rye=2

   and=6

   ...

 

Please produce two solutions:

Using the latest Javascript syntax via Babel or similar to approximate ES6/7
Using backwards compatible syntax that can run in many browsers
Rules:

Do not use any third party software (except standard pollyfills for part 1)
Please return one HTML file with that will run in a browser
Please focus on the Javascript.  HTML and CSS should be minimal.
This isn't a grammar test. You may ignore abbreviations, hyphenation, and most other punctuation.
The only punctuation that you do need to be concerned about is the single quote. Contractions should be seen as single words: "can't" should stay "can't" not "can" and "t". By the same token possessives should be maintained: "Jack's" should be counted separately than "Jack".
The tally should be case insensitive. "Hello" and "hello" are the same word.
The output data must consist of each word and the number of instances for each word.
